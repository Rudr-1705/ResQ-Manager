## Abstract

  <summary>Detail</summary>
  
  > Disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and cyclones create urgent demands for relief resources like transport vehicles, food packets, and shelter space. Manual allocation of these resources often results in delays, inefficiencies, and unfair distribution. This project, titled ResQ-Manager, proposes a hardware-oriented digital system that manages disaster relief requests using priority-based scheduling and finite state machine (FSM) logic. The system integrates three modules: a Transport Scheduler, a Food Resource Allocator, and a Shelter Availability Checker. Each request is assigned a priority level (Normal, High, Emergency), and the system ensures that higher-priority zones receive resources first while also implementing fairness mechanisms to avoid starvation. The Coordinator FSM orchestrates communication between modules, checks resource availability, and updates outputs through LEDs, seven-segment displays, and optional LCD modules. By combining combinational and sequential logic, this system demonstrates how digital design can be applied to solve real-world problems. The proposed solution highlights concepts of queue management, priority arbitration, and hardware-friendly scheduling algorithms, making it both educational and socially impactful. The final system can be simulated in FPGA/Logisim and later scaled into IoT-enabled prototypes for actual disaster management use.
